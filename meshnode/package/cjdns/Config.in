	  Encrypted near-zero-conf mesh routing protocol.

	  Cjdns implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public-key
	  cryptography for address allocation and a distributed hash table for
	  routing. This provides near-zero-configuration networking, and
	  prevents many of the security and scalability issues that plague
	  existing networks.
